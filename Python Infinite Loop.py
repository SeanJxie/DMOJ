"""
Almost everywhere on this site, we have always held infinite loops under poor regard. 
This is very unfair to infinite loops because they have their use too! Here, we compensate 
for the prejudice against them by awarding you points for creating one. However, there is a catch. 
You must do it as short as possible.

Input Specification

Output Specification
There are no outputs.

Scoring
Your score will be (9N)5Ã—7, where N is the length of your program in bytes, if your program works.
Otherwise, it will receive a score of zero.
