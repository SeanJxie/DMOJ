"""
FatalEagle is sitting in his computer science class, on his laptop. Clearly, he is not paying attention in this
situation. However, he gets called on by his computer science teacher to do some problems. Since his computer science
 teacher did not expect much from FatalEagle, he only needs to output the string Hello, World!. However, simple for you
 and I may not be simple for FatalEagle, so please help him!

FatalEagle's teacher is clever, and is able to determine that FatalEagle didn't write a solution himself if it uses
advanced concepts like strings or numbers. Since you don't want to get caught helping FatalEagle, you must make your
code look like his!

Input
There is none.
